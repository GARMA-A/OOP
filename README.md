# OOP in C#

## `public` keyword
<p>
    this mean i can access this class ,field , method from anywhere in my code.
</p>

## `private` keyword
<p>
    this mean i canot access this class ,field ,method from anywhere outside the class itself.
</p>

## `protected` keyword
<p>
    this mean i can access this class ,field ,method from anywhere in the class itself and in the derived classes (child classes).
</p>

## `static` keyword
```cs
class Counter
{
    public static int Count = 0;

    public Counter()
    {
        Count++; // shared by all objects
    }
}

// Usage:
var c1 = new Counter();
var c2 = new Counter();
Console.WriteLine(Counter.Count); // 2 (shared, not separate per object)

```
```cs
public static class MathHelper
{
    public static double Square(double x)
    {
        return x * x;
    }
}

// Usage:
double result = MathHelper.Square(5); // No "new", called on the class itself
//A static class cannot be instantiated (you canâ€™t use new on it).
// WARN:
double result2 = new MathHelper().Square(5); // This will not compile

```
```cs
class Config
{
    public static string AppName;

    static Config()
    {
        AppName = "MyApp"; // runs once
    }
}
//Runs only once, before the class is used for the first time.
//Used to initialize static fields.
```
### method override 
<p>
    this is when child class implement the same method of the parent class
    but with different body 
</p>

### method  overload
<p>
    this is when you have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (different type or number of parameters).
</p>

### Encapsulation
<p>
    is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. Encapsulation is achieved through access modifiers like `public`, `private`, `protected`, and `internal`.
</p>

```cs
public class Car
{
    public string Model { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }
    public double Mileage { get; private set; }

    public Car(string model, int year)
    {
        Model = model;
        Year = year;
        Mileage = 0.0;
    }

    public virtual void Drive(double distance)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"the Car class is driving {distance} miles.");
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"{Year} {Model} with {Mileage} miles";
    }


}
```

```cs
public class Vehicle : Car
{

    private int _numberOfWheels;
    public int numberOfWheels
    {
        get { return _numberOfWheels; }
        set { _numberOfWheels = value; }
    }

    private string make;

    public Vehicle(string model, int year, string make) : base(model, year)
    {
        this.make = make;
        numberOfWheels = 4;

    }
    public override void Drive(double distance)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"The Vehicle class is driving {distance} miles.");

    }


}
```
```cs
List<Object> objects = new List<Object>();
objects.Add(new Car("Object1", 10));
objects.Add(new Vehicle("Object2", 20, "Toyota"));

foreach (var obj in objects)
{

    if (obj is Vehicle vehicle)
    {
        vehicle.Drive(200);
    }
    else if (obj is Car car)
    {
        car.Drive(100);
    }
}
//the Car class is driving 100 miles.
//The Vehicle class is driving 200 miles.
// if we swap the two if conditions , the output will be 

foreach (var obj in objects)
{

     if (obj is Car car)
    {
        car.Drive(100);
    }
    else if (obj is Vehicle vehicle)
    {
        vehicle.Drive(200);
    }
}
// output
//the Car class is driving 100 miles.
//The Vehicle class is driving 100 miles.

```
